In this laboratory work I used three creational design patterns: command, facade and composite. I developed a Rails application where the staff of a hotel can input the cients' orders and automatically sends these orders to the specified departments that need to take care of the order (for example the kitchen). 

1. **Command**
As I said earlier, in this app we the hotel's staff can create orders by completing a form.
