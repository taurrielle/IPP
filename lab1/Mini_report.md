In this laboratory work I used three creational design patterns: **abstract factory**, **singleton** and **prototype**. 

1. **Abstract factory**

In this laboratory work I created a pizza store that serves, you guessed it, PIZZA. However, it also has wine and a sommelier that serves it. This sommelier is a really crappy one if you ask me because he serves only two types of wine: red and white. But his skills are not the point here.
